This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Perl related to the `exists` function and how it interacts with hash keys that have values that evaluate to false in a boolean context.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code and `bugSolution.pl` shows the corrected version.  The issue arises when testing for the existence of a key whose value might be 0 or an empty string, which Perl considers false, leading to an incorrect determination of key existence.
